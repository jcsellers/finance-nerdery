# High-Level Design Document

## Overview
The Analysis Core for the "Finance Nerdery" project will provide a robust framework for evaluating financial strategies and metrics using validated datasets stored in SQLite. The system will calculate key performance metrics, enable strategy comparisons against benchmarks, and generate trade statistics and visualization-ready outputs.

### Inputs
- **Data Source:** SQLite database
  - Tables: Aligned datasets for equities, economic indicators, and indexes
  - Columns: `ticker`, `date`, `open`, `close`, `high`, `low`, `volume`, and additional derived metrics as required
- **User Inputs:**
  - **Tickers:** Selected equities or indexes
  - **Date Ranges:** Start and end dates for analysis
  - **Strategies:** User-defined strategies (e.g., buy-and-hold, moving average crossover)
  - **Benchmarks:** Reference benchmarks (e.g., SPY, ^SPX)

### Processes
1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Query SQLite database for the required tickers and date range.
   - Ensure datasets are aligned by date and have sufficient data points.

2. **Metric Calculations:**
   - **CAGR:** Calculate annualized growth rate from start to end value.
   - **Volatility:** Measure standard deviation of returns.
   - **Sharpe Ratio:** Assess risk-adjusted returns.
   - **Alpha and Beta:** Evaluate strategy performance against a benchmark using regression.
   - **Trade Statistics:** Compute metrics such as win rate, average gain/loss, and max drawdown.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - Apply user-defined strategies to the retrieved dataset.
   - Benchmark results against predefined indices (e.g., SPY).

4. **Output Generation:**
   - Structured outputs: CSV and JSON files with calculated metrics.
   - Visualization-ready datasets for charts (e.g., equity curves, return distributions).

### Outputs
- **Metrics Summary:**
  - CAGR, Sharpe ratio, alpha, beta, volatility, trade statistics
- **Comparison Results:**
  - Strategy vs. Benchmark performance metrics
- **Visualization Data:**
  - Ready-to-plot datasets for visual insights

### Data Flow
1. User selects tickers, date range, and strategies.
2. System queries the SQLite database.
3. Aligned data is processed to calculate metrics.
4. Strategy performance is benchmarked and compared.
5. Results are output as structured files and visualization-ready data.

## List of Requirements

1. **Metric Calculations:**
   - Implement functions for CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, alpha, beta, and trade statistics.
   - Edge Cases:
     - Handle insufficient data points (e.g., less than 30 days for Sharpe ratio).
     - Validate alignment of datasets by date.

2. **Strategy Integration:**
   - Accept user-defined strategies as Python functions or JSON configurations.
   - Provide a framework for benchmarking against predefined indices.

3. **Input and Output:**
   - Inputs:
     - SQLite database connection
     - User-selected tickers, date ranges, and strategies
   - Outputs:
     - CSV/JSON files with metrics
     - Datasets formatted for visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly)

4. **Extensibility:**
   - Modular design to add new metrics or strategy types.
   - Include a configuration file for easy customization.

5. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Validate sufficient data points and alignment.
   - Log errors (e.g., missing data, incorrect strategy definitions) and provide user feedback.
   - Handle SQLite connection failures gracefully.

## Suggestions for Tools
- **Data Handling:** pandas, SQLite (via `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`)
- **Metrics Calculations:** NumPy, SciPy (for statistical metrics)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly, or Seaborn
- **Error Logging:** Python `logging` module
- **Benchmarking and Regression:** statsmodels, scikit-learn

This design document outlines the architecture and requirements for developing the Analysis Core. The next step is to delegate implementation to a Developer GPT, focusing on modularity and extensibility.
