# GPT Collaboration Guide

This document explains how to assign and manage tasks with GPTs using GitHub Issues for the **finance-nerdery** project.

---

## Workflow

### **1. Write the Task in a GitHub Issue**
- Clearly describe the task.
- Include the following details:
  - **Objective**: What needs to be done.
  - **Deliverables**: Outputs expected from the task.
  - **Timeline**: Specify a deadline (if applicable).
  - **Mentions**: Use `@Coder-GPT`, `@Database-GPT`, etc., to assign the task.

### **2. Notify the GPT**
- Start a chat with the GPT responsible for the task.
- Provide the GitHub Issue link.
- Example message:
  ```markdown
  Please pull the task from [Issue #9](https://github.com/jcsellers/finance-nerdery/issues/9). The task is assigned to `@Coder-GPT`. Let me know once you've started or if clarification is needed.
