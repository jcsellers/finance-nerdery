**Design Document: Buy-and-Hold Strategy Implementation**

### **Overview**
This document specifies the requirements, inputs, workflow, and outputs for implementing and testing a Buy-and-Hold trading strategy with and without rebalancing.

---

### **1. Objective**
To simulate a Buy-and-Hold strategy on a portfolio of selected tickers, with optional rebalancing. The implementation will support:
1. Simple Buy-and-Hold: No rebalancing after the initial purchase.
2. Buy-and-Hold with Rebalancing: Periodic reallocation to maintain target weights.

---

### **2. Requirements**
1. **Input Data**:
   - Historical price data (Open/Close) for selected tickers.
   - Start and end dates for the simulation.
   - Initial capital.
   - Portfolio target allocations (e.g., 60% SPY, 40% TLT).
   - Optional: Rebalancing frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly).

2. **Functionality**:
   - Execute trades to establish initial portfolio.
   - Track portfolio value over time based on price changes.
   - Handle periodic rebalancing if enabled.
   - Calculate and output key performance metrics.

3. **Output**:
   - Time series of portfolio value.
   - Allocation history (if rebalancing).
   - Performance metrics (CAGR, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, volatility).

---

### **3. Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Input Handling**
- Load historical price data for selected tickers.
- Validate input parameters (e.g., allocations sum to 100%, dates align with data).

#### **Step 2: Initialize Portfolio**
- Calculate initial trade sizes based on:
  - Initial capital.
  - Target allocations.
  - First available prices in the dataset.
- Execute trades to establish the starting portfolio.

#### **Step 3: Simulate Portfolio Performance**
1. **Without Rebalancing**:
   - Calculate portfolio value at each time step based on price changes.
2. **With Rebalancing**:
   - Recalculate allocations at specified intervals (e.g., monthly).
   - Adjust holdings to maintain target weights.

#### **Step 4: Generate Outputs**
- Time series of portfolio value.
- Time series of allocations (if rebalancing).
- Performance metrics:
  - Total return
  - CAGR
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Drawdown
  - Volatility

### **4. Function Specifications**

#### **Core Functions**
1. **`initialize_portfolio()`**:
   - **Inputs:** Initial capital, target allocations, first prices.
   - **Outputs:** Initial holdings.
   - **Logic:**
     - Calculate the number of shares to buy for each ticker.
     - Track cash remaining (if any).

2. **`simulate_portfolio()`**:
   - **Inputs:** Holdings, price data, rebalancing frequency (optional).
   - **Outputs:** Time series of portfolio value, allocation history.
   - **Logic:**
     - Iterate through each time step in the data.
     - Update portfolio value based on price changes.
     - Apply rebalancing logic if frequency is specified.

3. **`rebalance_portfolio()`**:
   - **Inputs:** Current holdings, target allocations, current prices.
   - **Outputs:** Updated holdings after rebalancing.
   - **Logic:**
     - Calculate portfolio value.
     - Determine required trades to match target weights.
     - Adjust holdings accordingly.

4. **`calculate_metrics()`**:
   - **Inputs:** Portfolio time series.
   - **Outputs:** Performance metrics (CAGR, Sharpe ratio, etc.).
   - **Logic:**
     - Compute metrics based on portfolio value changes over time.

---

### **5. Testing Plan**

#### **Test Data**
- Tickers: `SPY`, `TLT`
- Historical period: Last 5 years (or available data range).
- Initial capital: $10,000.
- Target allocations: 60% SPY, 40% TLT.
- Rebalancing frequency: Monthly.

#### **Test Cases**
1. **Simple Buy-and-Hold:**
   - Verify portfolio value matches expected returns without rebalancing.
   - Check allocations remain constant over time.

2. **Buy-and-Hold with Rebalancing:**
   - Verify rebalancing occurs at specified intervals.
   - Check allocations realign to targets after each rebalance.

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Confirm metrics match expected values based on historical data.

#### **Validation Criteria**
- Outputs align with known benchmarks for the given test data.
- Portfolio value and allocations are consistent with trade logic.
- Metrics are accurate and reproducible.

---

### **6. Deliverables**
- Fully implemented Buy-and-Hold strategy (with and without rebalancing).
- End-to-end test script with sample data.
- Performance report comparing both variations.

---

### **7. Collaboration Plan**
- **FN_Developer GPT:** Implement core functions and testing script.
- **FN_Architect GPT:** Review implementation, validate outputs, and refine the design.

---

### **8. Next Steps**
1. Assign tasks to Developer GPT.
2. Validate initial implementation against test cases.
3. Iterate based on findings and feedback.
